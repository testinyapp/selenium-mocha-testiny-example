# Selenium - Mocha - Mochawesome - Testiny Example

This repository contains an example on how to run Selenium Tests with Mocha, generating Mochawesome JSON Reports and uploading results (including screenshots on failure) to Testiny.

The Testiny CLI supports Selenium / Mochawesome JSON reports with `--mochawesome` option. If you're using a different test runner for Selenium, following report options are also supported by Testiny CLI: `--xunit`, `--nunit`, `--junit`, `--testng` & more.
